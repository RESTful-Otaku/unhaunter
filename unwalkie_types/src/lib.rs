//! This crate defines shared types used by the `walkie_voice_generator` tool
//! and the main `unwalkie` game crate for managing walkie-talkie voice lines.
//! It includes the `WalkieTag` enum for categorising voice lines and the
//! `VoiceLineData` struct for holding metadata about each generated audio file.
